# README

This repository contains the notes and code from [Neil Cummings](https://www.udemy.com/user/neil-cummings-2/) [Complete guide to building an app with .Net Core and React](https://www.udemy.com/share/101Ae6AkAacFhaQ3w=/) on Udemy. 

## Course Description 

Have you learnt the basics of ASP.NET Core and React? Not sure where to go next? This course should be able to help with that. In this course we learn how to build a multi-project ASP.NET Core solution that is built using Clean Architecture and the CQRS and Mediator pattern that makes our code easy to understand, reason about and extend.

Both ASP.NET Core and React are hot topics and this course will enhance your knowledge of both, simply by building an application from start to finish. In each module we learn something new, whilst incrementally adding features to the application. Building an application is significantly more rewarding than building yet another Todo List from the documentation!

## Learning Goals 

* build an application from start to publishing with .Net Core (v3), React (with Typescript) and Mobx
* build a Web API in .Net Core with Clean Architecture using the CQRS + Mediator pattern
* use AutoMapper and MediatR packages in the .Net projects
* build a multi-project solution with .Net Core
* use Entity Framework Core as the Object Relational Mapper
* integrate ASPNET Core SignalR into an application for real time web communication
* add Identity and Authentication using .Net Core Identity
* build a Client side application for the API with React
* use MobX as a state management library
* build our own Photo upload widget with a Dropzone and a Cropper to resize images

## Course Contents: 

* Here are some of the things you will learn about in this course:
* Setting up the developer environment
* Creating a multi-project solution using the the ASP.NET Core WebAPI and the React app using the DotNet CLI and the * create-react-app utility.
* Clean Architecture and the CQRS + Mediator pattern
* Setting up and configuring ASP.NET Core identity for authentication
* Using React with Typescript
* Adding a Client side login and register function to our React application
* Using React Router
* Using AutoMapper in ASP.NET Core
* Building a great looking UI using Semantic UI
* Adding Photo Upload widget and creating user profile pages
* Using React Final Form to create re-usable form inputs with validation
* Paging, Sorting and Filtering
* Using SignalR to enable real time web communication to a chat feature in our app
* Publishing the application to both IIS and Linux
* Getting an ‘A’ rating for security from a well known security scanning site.
* Many more things as well
